# HIbernate_JPA
CRUD = **C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete

--> The practical implementation of CRUD operations using the Hibernate ORM and JPA performed on MySql database to understand the core concepts of Persistence Unit and the connection     
     configuration with the maven project for mapping the object

--> Hibernate is ORM (Object-Relational-Mapping) Framework to save **Java Objects in DataBase Systems**.

--> In this Repo I had done Basic **_JPQL_** Java-Persistent-Query-Language that reduces the work of database queries and we can append our logic dynamically in Java Objects.
